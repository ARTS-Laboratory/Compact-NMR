# Compact-NMR (cNMR)

A compact Time-Domain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (TD-NMR) system. The system is made up of custom NMR electronics with a compact and rugged permanent magnet array designed to enable future deployment as an in situ sensor. A signal-to-noise ratio of 25 dB has been demonstrated for a single scan, and sufficient data can be acquired in one minute for Time-Domain measurements. A high-level overview of the system is presented in Figures 1-5. For more details related to its potential use, refer to references [1] and [2].
