# Compact-NMR (cNMR) - Systems Development 

## Version 0.1 Rabi
* A full-scale development system that uses full-size amplifiers, filters, and switches. 
* A working prototype was developed.

## Version 0.2 - Bloch
* A full-scale development that combines amplifiers, filters, and switches onto custom PCB boards.
* Temperature regulation was added for increased system stability and testing accuracy.

## Version 0.3 - Purcell
* A smaller and portable device with reduced power consumption and physical footprint intended for in situ environmental monitoring.
* A new compact magnet was designed and temperature regulation has been removed in favor of a frequency calibration method.
