# Compact-NMR (cNMR) - v0.1 - Rabi

Main aspects of this version are:
* The circuitry included large RF components with SMA connections.
* The initial static magnetic field was generated using two bare, cylindrical N42 magnets.
* RF signal generation, square pulse generation, and data acquisition is controlled by an NI PXI chassis.
* The magnet design was later upgraded with carbon steel bars to be stronger and more homogenous.
