# Compact-NMR (cNMR) - v0.2 - Bloch

Main aspects of this version are:
* Most large RF components are replaced with PCB mounted versions.
* The goal is to have the RF signal routing and amplification electronics on one PCB.
* Temperature regulation was added to help increase the magnet stability (which affects testing stability).
* Only one 24V power supply is needed - PCB mounted linear regulators are used to step it down
* Another goal is to get signal generation and data acquisition compacted to on or more PCBs.
