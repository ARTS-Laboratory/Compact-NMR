# Compact-NMR (cNMR) - v0.3 - Purcell

Main aspects of this version are:
* The goal is to further compact the system for in situ measurements/monitoring.
* All routing components are PCB mounted - RF power amplifier and RF LNA are small blocks with SMA ports.
* Want to replace PXI cards with embedded/portable signal generator and data acquisition devices
* Reduced permanent magnet size
