# Embedded Controller
This is the working directly for an embedded controller that combines data acquisition and control into a single embedded system with remote access capabilities.  

## Zmod based system
Zmods from Digilent (or maybe others) are a semi-low cost way to get modulal high-performance hardware. We will start with a Eclypse Z7: Zynq-7000 SoC system. 

### Hardware
If you buy the base board, the AWG, and the scope as a kits, the total cost is $583 - July 2022
