Literature that was fundamental in the development of the cNMR system. 


1. Pulsed NMR Lab (Berkeley)
    + This is not a paper, but it is a lab at Berkeley where they investigate pulsed and continuous NMR. It does a great job of showing the details of the schematic and setup, as well as explain a lot of the theory behind it.

    + This paper is about how a French group designed and built a benchtop NMR spectrometer. It is super helpful and explains the steps that they took as well as all of the specific equipment used. The data, however, is not presented very well and is a bit hard to view. 
    + “In this article, we describe the realization of an NMR instrument based on electronic components and boards (LNA, ADC, FPGA, ARM, DDS…) easily commercially available”

    +	This is another decent paper on how a miniature NMR experiment was set up and tested but using a Halbach magnet design rather than two pancake type magnets. Given the design and the fact that there isn’t a lot of amplification or separation from probe/acquisition, I don’t really understand how they actually got it to work. Nonetheless, it’s a good example of a possible mini-NMR setup. 
    +	“A simple NMR relaxation time experiment was performed on a water sample doped with 40 mM of CuSO4. This system in its current configuration is suitable for relaxation time studies of materials or for educational use. The introduction of shim coils would increase the homogeneity of the magnet by a factor of 100, allowing the system to be used as a portable NMR spectrometer.”
